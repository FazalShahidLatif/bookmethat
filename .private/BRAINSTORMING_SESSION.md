### **2. PRICING STRATEGY**

**Question:** How to monetize while staying competitive?

**Revenue Models to Consider:**

**A. Commission-Based** (Recommended)

- No visible fees to user (included in price)
- Similar to Booking.com model
- **Pros:** Simple, scales with revenue
- **Cons:** Lower margin per transaction

**B. Service Fee Model**
- Fixed service fee per booking (PKR 50-100)
- Visible to user at checkout
- Similar to ticketing platforms
- **Pros:** Predictable per-transaction revenue
- **Cons:** May deter price-sensitive users

**C. Hybrid Model** (Most Flexible)
- Commission on hotels/flights (2-5%)
- Small service fee on trains (PKR 50)
- No fee on eSIM (commission from provider)
- **Pros:** Optimized for each service type
- **Cons:** Complex to communicate

**D. Premium Features**
- Free basic booking
- Paid features:
  * Priority customer support
  * Travel insurance
  * Flexible cancellation
  * Premium payment methods
- **Pros:** Low barrier to entry
- **Cons:** Complex to implement

**Initial Recommendation:**
- **Trains:** PKR 50 service fee (transparent)
